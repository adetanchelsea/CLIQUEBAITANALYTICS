# Clique Bait Analytics with SnowFlake and Streamlit ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview
This project was inspired by the **8-Week SQL Challenge (Case Study 6 â€“ Clique Bait)**.  
Clique Bait is an online seafood store that runs digital marketing campaigns to attract customers.  
The goal of this project was to **analyze user behavior**, **track campaign effectiveness**, and **understand the product purchase funnel**.  

To make the insights interactive and accessible, I built a **Streamlit dashboard** that visualizes outputs directly from Snowflake.
